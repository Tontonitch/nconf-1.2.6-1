Release 1.2.6 (2009-11-26)

FIXED    'permission denied' bug when a 'normal' user tries to clear a form
FIXED    'unknown' user bug in history entry when generating updated Nagios config
FIXED    max_length limit of 'address' field when cloning a host
FIXED    a bug within the input form for service parameters (proper handling of the '!' character)
FIXED    a problem with 'multi_modify' not enforcing ONCALL_GROUPS setting
FIXED    quotes bug " (double) and ' (single) in the Attributes -> Show / Add form for attributes of type 'select' 
         and in all other text fields (attribute & friendly name, description, possible values, pre-defined value)

ADDED    CSV importer and example scripts to import any type of items from a CSV file into NConf
ADDED    an ID-wrapper script (id_wrapper.php) that allows users to embed a link to the NConf 'details' page,
         knowing only the name of an item (item name and item class are passed as GET-parameters)
ADDED    configuration option OVERVIEW_QUANTITY_STANDARD
ADDED    configuration option SELECT_VALUE_SEPARATOR
ADDED    'host-template' class and attributes, added several predefined host-template items
ADDED    'service-template' class and attributes, added several predefined service-template items
ADDED    'use' attribute to 'hosts' & 'services' classes
ADDED    a new 'host_template' and 'service_template' attribute to timeperiods, nagios-collectors and nagios-monitors. This allows users to 
         specify templates to be auto-assigned to each service which is linked with these items.
ADDED    'default_service_name' attribute to checkcommand class. This value will be used when adding new services instead of the checkcommand name.
ADDED    'notes' and 'notes_url' attributes to hostgroup and servicegroup classes.
ADDED    'stale_service_command' attribute to 'nagios-monitor' class. If set, this writes a 'dummy' check_command to all services on a 'nagios-monitor.
         The 'dummy' check_command is therefore no longer triggered by the 'active_checks_enabled' flag.
ADDED    new datatype 'assign_cust_order' to ConfigAttrs table and GUIs. This allows users to specify the order of how linked items 
         should be written to the config (necessary for 'use' attributes to define order of templates).
MERGED   generate_config.pl with NConf perl-API, moved certain functions to perl modules

RENAMED  old NConf host-templates to 'host presets'
RENAMED  'normal_check_interval' and 'retry_check_interval' attributes to 'check_interval' and 'retry_interval'

CHANGED  'add service': services can be re-used for same host without having to rename existing ones first (service auto-renamed to '_2')

CHANGED  'advanced' tab to remain open while switching views (requires cookies to be enabled in browser)

CHANGED  several host, service, timeperiod, nagios-collector and nagios-monitor attributes from 'mandatory' to 'not mandatory'
